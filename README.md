# Kwadrats game to blow your mind and mouse/touchpad

Kwadrats is a simple game in which goal is to control white squares to hit dark squares coming from the other side of board. You can move your ›bullets‹ on y-axis with mouse. There’s one useful action attached to ›mouse click‹ event. 

This is my very first Canvas/ClojureScript game. It’s not meant to be the greatest example of its kind. Just wanna have fun and get to know better Canvas API as well as explore infinite ClojureScript posibillites
